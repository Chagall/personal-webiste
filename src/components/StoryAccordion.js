              decided to install a couple of games before handing it over. One

              Fast forward to the beginning of high school, I first learned
              about <code>programming</code> when me and a few friend who used

              were programming back then, but it was the purest form of joy.

              A couple years later, at the end of high school, I was presented
              with the life changing question of what career I wanted to pursue.
              I was never good at math and physics, so even though I enjoyed
              computers I didnâ€™t think I was smart enough to purse a career in{" "}
              <a

                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                <code>STEM</code>
              </a>
              . That lead me to start a <code>bachelorâ€™s degree in law</code>.,
              which was what most people in my school were doing, and what my
              sister and father also did.
            </Typography>
            <Typography color="textSecondary" align="justify" paragraph>
              Halfway through my degree I was unsatisfied. I had one the best
              grades in my class I just couldn&apos;t see myself as being a
              lawyer, public prosecutor, judge or anything like that. One day
              while talking to a friend (one of those who helped build that
              Tibia server) I came to the conclusion that law was definitely not
              what I wanted to work with. I liked computers and games, that was
              what I was supposed to be doing. So before the semester started, I
              decided to quit my university and go back to study to be accepted
              at a computer science course.
            </Typography>
            <Typography color="textSecondary" align="justify" paragraph>
              Since I was giving up on so much I decided to study hard and aim
              at the best university I could get into. That commitment let me to
              be accepted at{" "}

              , which is regarded as the best university in Brazil. There I
              studied{" "}

              , had to deal with calculus, probabilities, differential equations
              and all of that stuff. Iâ€™m not gonna lie, it was pretty hard for a
              dude who had been studying law to grasp all of those concepts.
              But, not only did I prove myself wrong, that I could indeed deal
              with math and physics, but also that I could also do it at
              supposedly the hardest university there could be.

            <Typography color="textSecondary" align="justify" paragraph>
              I met a lot of great people at the university, had the experience
              of living far away from home (700 km!) and taking{" "}
              <span style={textThrough}>good</span> care of myself. The climb
              was hard, salty, with a lot of rocks, (still is tbh, see 2020
              lol), but itâ€™s being worth every minute of discovery, growth and
              banging my head against the keyboard when the code doesn&apos;t
              compile.
