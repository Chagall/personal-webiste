            I first got into computer stuff at the end of the 90â€™s, when my

            Fast forward to the beginning of high school, I first learned about{" "}

            were programming back then, but it was fun.

            A couple years later, at the end of high school, I was presented
            with the life changing question of what career I wanted to pursue. I
            was never good at math and physics, so even though I enjoyed
            computers I didnâ€™t think I was smart enough for that kind of stuff.
            That insecurity lead me to start a{" "}
            <code>bachelorâ€™s degree in law</code>.
          </Typography>
          <Typography color="textSecondary" align="left" paragraph>
            Halfway through my degree I was unsatisfied. I wasnâ€™t doing bad, but
            I didnâ€™t enjoy any of the classes. One day while talking to a friend
            (one of those who helped build that Tibia server) I came to the
            conclusion that law was definitely not what I wanted to work with. I
            liked computers and games, that was what I was supposed to be doing.
            So not only did I quit the university I was in, but I also aimed
            high. I wanted to study computer science, but not anywhere, I wanted
            to join the best university my hands could grasp.
          </Typography>
          <Typography color="textSecondary" align="left" paragraph>
            I studied hard and got accepted at{" "}
            <a
              href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo"

              <code>Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP)</code>
            </a>
            , which is regarded as the best university in Brazil. There I
            studied{" "}
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"
              target="_blank"

              <code>Computer Science</code>
            </a>
            , had to deal with calculus, probabilities, differential equations
            and all of that stuff. Iâ€™m not gonna lie, it was pretty hard for a
            dude who had been studying law to grasp all of those concepts. But,
            not only did I prove myself wrong, that I could indeed deal with
            math and physics, but also that I could also do it at supposedly the
            hardest university there could be.
          </Typography>
          <Typography color="textSecondary" align="left" paragraph>
            I met a lot of great people at the university, had the experience of
            living far away from home (700 km!) and taking{" "}
            <span style={textThrough}>good</span> care of myself. The climb was
            hard, salty, with a lot of rocks, (still is tbh, see 2020 lol), but
            itâ€™s being worth every minute of discovery, growth and banging my
            head against the keyboard when the code doesn&apos;t compile. Well,
            as far as I can remember and summarize my personal life, thatâ€™s my
            story so farâ€¦
